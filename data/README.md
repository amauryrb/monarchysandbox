# Data Documentation for Monarchy Sandbox Simulation

This README file provides an overview of the data used in the Monarchy Sandbox project. It includes descriptions of the datasets, their formats, and how they are utilized within the simulation.

## Datasets

### Simulation Parameters
- **Description**: This dataset contains the initial parameters for the simulation, including population fractions, church influence, state power, and resource levels.
- **Format**: JSON or CSV format, depending on the implementation.

### Simulation Results
- **Description**: This dataset captures the results of the simulation over time, including population dynamics (Monarchists, Liberals, Undecided), resources, legitimacy, and state capacity.
- **Format**: CSV format, with columns representing time steps and corresponding values for each variable.

## Usage
The data files are used by the simulation scripts to initialize the simulation environment and to store results for analysis and visualization. Ensure that the data files are correctly formatted and located in the appropriate directory for the simulation to run smoothly.

## Contribution
If you wish to contribute to the data or suggest changes, please follow the contribution guidelines outlined in the main README file of the project.
